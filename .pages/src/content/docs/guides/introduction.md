# Introduction to Objective-R

Objective-R is a superset of Rust that adds first-class support for object-oriented programming while maintaining Rust's performance and safety guarantees.

## Key Features

- **Full Rust Compatibility**: Any valid Rust code is valid Objective-R code
- **Class-based Objects**: Define classes with inheritance and polymorphism
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: OOP features compile to efficient Rust code
- **Memory Safety**: Maintains Rust's ownership and borrowing rules

## Basic Example
